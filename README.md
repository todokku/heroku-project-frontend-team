## Contributing

Although it's just a few of us, it's good for us to use Pull Requests to review changes and give feedback. Follow the following steps to contribute to this project:

**pull from origin master**

1. Create a new branch, naming it by the feature you are implementing.
2. Make changes locally
3. Open a Pull Request to merge to master.
4. Wait for a review, it will get merged ASAP.

If you have small edits or post-merge minor fixes, it's ok to push to master.

## Development

Recommended code editor: VSCode, Atom, Sublime, IntelliJ

We are using 2 extensions to keep our code consistent and accurate:

1. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
2. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)

Make sure to look at your browser's extension store and find them there.

Run `npm start`, this will set up your development envirment on `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Deploying

We have automatic deploys to Heroku, any merges to master will deploy to heroku to be seen at [https://usfcs-perf-eng-s20-frontend.herokuapp.com/](https://usfcs-perf-eng-s20-frontend.herokuapp.com/).
